That selection made them eligible for $20K in scholarship prizes.\n\nIn New York City on April 29,  Rishabh Chhabra, Om Gole, Rishabh Prabhu, Laura Zhang, and Victoria Zhang placed second in the contest, taking home $15,000. The winners are from Phillips Academy, based in Andover MA.\n\n“What sets M3 Challenge apart from other math competitions is that it uniquely requires students to use math modeling as a process to represent, analyze, make predictions and provide insight into current phenomena,” said Dr. Karen Bliss, Senior Manager of Education and Outreach at SIAM. “We pose big problems about real issues that many students may not know much about. They need to research, quantify the parameters, organize data, and use skills they’ve learned in math class but may have never related to something real.”\n\nThe M3 Challenge is a program of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, headquartered in Philadelphia. It is sponsored by MathWorks, and began in 2005. It highlights the importance of math in daily life.\n\nSupport Good News Journalism, Subscribe >>\n\nThe judging panel for the final included professional mathematiciains.\n\nThousands of students from the US and UK participate in the M3 Challenge each year. Only six percent of entrants were given scholarship prizes.\n\n[SEE ALSO: What’s Happening This Summer in Alexandria?]\n\nM3 Challenge math Thomas Jefferson High School\n Share\nFacebook\n \nTwitter\n \nLinkedIn\n \nTumblr\n \nPinterest\n \nReddit\n \nVKontakte\n \nOdnoklassniki\n \nPocket\n \nMessenger\n \nShare via Email\n \nPrint\nKevin Dauray\nKevin is Publisher's Assistant with The Zebra Press.
